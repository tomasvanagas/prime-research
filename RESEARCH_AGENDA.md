# Research Agenda — Long-Horizon Arcs

This file holds **multi-session research arcs**. Each arc is a research
direction that takes more than one session to pursue. Arcs survive
across sessions, accumulate state, and have explicit next-actions.

This file is for *continuity*. NOVELTY_CHALLENGES.md is for *targets*.
EDGES.md is for *verified facts*. CLOSED_PATHS.md is for *failures*.

## Active arcs

### Arc 1 — Three-Barriers Paper (synthesis)
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Owner:** any agent who picks it up
**Goal:** A paper-grade unification of E7.6 + E7.10 + E5.8 + E7.11 into
a single negative-result manuscript. See `NOVELTY_CHALLENGES.md` §5.S1.

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Outline the four sections (one per closure family).
- [ ] Write precise statement of each family-level closure as a theorem
  (E7.6 = sieve / pebbling; E7.10 = AKS modulus-twist orthogonality;
  E5.8 = Brandt structural-welding; E7.11 = convergence-acceleration
  exhaustion).
- [ ] Write a unified introduction framing the four as "structural
  barriers to polylog π(x)".
- [ ] Cross-reference with Williams-Hirahara, Razborov-Rudich,
  Bombieri-Vinogradov, the Aggarwal optimum.
- [ ] First full draft.
- [ ] Self-review pass for false claims and inflated scope.
- [ ] Save to `novel/three_structural_barriers.md`; on completion move
  a polished version to `literature/preprint_three_barriers.md`.

**Estimated total effort:** 4-6 sessions of dedicated work.
**Next action:** outline the four sections in `novel/three_structural_barriers_outline.md`.

**Why this arc matters:** the project has produced four genuinely
publishable structural results. None is published. A single coherent
preprint is the highest-leverage output the project can produce.

### Arc 2 — Lean Formalisation Track
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Owner:** any agent who picks it up
**Goal:** Permanent verifiable artifacts for the project's main results.
See `NOVELTY_CHALLENGES.md` §3.

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Set up `experiments/formalisations/` with a Lean 4 toolchain
  (lakefile.lean, mathlib4 dependency).
- [ ] Pick L1 (E2.1 MPS bond-dim) as first formalisation.
- [ ] Statement-only Lean file (theorem statement, no proof).
- [ ] Proof skeleton with `sorry` placeholders.
- [ ] Lemma 1: CRT-based count of φ(W)·W^{d-j-1} columns coprime to W.
- [ ] Lemma 2: row-0 dimension extension argument.
- [ ] Main theorem proof.
- [ ] Repeat for L2, L3, L4, L5.

**Estimated total effort:** L1 alone is 1-2 sessions; full queue is
12-20 sessions.
**Next action:** verify Lean 4 + mathlib4 are installable in the
project environment.

### Arc 3 — Per-Bit Polylog Boundary
**Status:** OPEN, untouched
**Owner:** any agent who picks it up
**Goal:** Find J such that bit_J(π(x)) is provably polylog-computable
for fixed J independent of N. See `NOVELTY_CHALLENGES.md` §2.F1.

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Re-read `novel/carry_propagation_boundary.md` for the J = 0..0.6N
  smooth zone.
- [ ] Define bit_J(π(x)) precisely as a Boolean function.
- [ ] For J ∈ {0, N/4, N/2, 0.6N, 0.8N, N}, measure agreement between
  bit_J(π(x)) and bit_J(round(R^{-1}(n))) at scale x ≤ 10^9.
- [ ] Identify the empirical sigmoid boundary and verify against E1.3.
- [ ] Build a polylog circuit for the largest J that's still in the
  smooth region.
- [ ] If J = 0.6N is provably polylog while J = 0.7N is not, the
  boundary IS a publishable mathematical fact.

**Estimated total effort:** 3-5 sessions.
**Next action:** read E1.3 source experiment and the carry-propagation
boundary novel doc.

### Arc 4 — Composition over EDGES.md
**Status:** SUGGESTED, not yet picked up
**Owner:** any agent
**Goal:** Systematically explore the "compose two edges" challenge space.
See `NOVELTY_CHALLENGES.md` §1.

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Pick C1 (A⊕C₃ × 0.537 invariant). Build it. Close or extend.
- [ ] Pick C2 (free cumulants × MPS bond-dim). Build it. Close or extend.
- [ ] Pick C3 (Brandt × per-bit). Build it. Close or extend.
- [ ] Pick C4 (Aggarwal × Dusart × BPSW). Build the unified library.
- [ ] After 4-6 compositions, write a meta-synthesis: which edge pairs
  yielded structure, which collapsed?

**Estimated total effort:** 1-2 sessions per composition × 4-6 compositions = 5-12 sessions.
**Next action:** pick the easiest (C1) and start.

### Arc 5 — Frame-Shift exploration
**Status:** SUGGESTED
**Owner:** any agent
**Goal:** Test whether the local minimum of "polylog π(x)" frame can
be escaped. See `NOVELTY_CHALLENGES.md` §2.

**Milestones:**
- [ ] F1 (per-bit): subsumed by Arc 3.
- [x] F2 (mod 2^k saturation): **DONE S69 (information-rate side).**
  Closed-form refinement of E1.5: `H(π mod m | π_{x-1} mod m) =
  h_2(π(X)/X) + O(1/π(X))` for m ≪ π(X). See
  `experiments/information_theory/pi_mod_2k_saturation/`.
  Pseudorandomness-battery side of F2 still open.
- [ ] F3 (oracle complexity model): one-session theoretical work.
- [ ] F4 (π_BD = π − π_smooth): one-session empirical.
- [ ] F5 (find a TC⁰ function with π-comparable statistics): two-session.
- [ ] F6 (parametric family π(2^k)): one-session empirical.
- [ ] After 4-5 frame-shifts, synthesise: did any frame yield genuine
  structure?

**Estimated total effort:** ~6 sessions.
**Next action:** pick F4 (empirical, fast) or F6 (parametric family).
F2 information-rate side closed S69; pseudorandomness-battery side
remains open if anyone wants the cross-check.

### Arc 6 — External collaboration outreach
**Status:** SUGGESTED, requires user action
**Owner:** USER (cannot be done by agents alone)
**Goal:** Get external mathematician review of the EDGES.md catalogue
to identify directions agents have missed.

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Write a 2-page summary of the project state for cold review.
- [ ] Identify 3-5 candidate reviewers (analytic NT or complexity).
- [ ] Send EDGES.md + summary.
- [ ] Incorporate any direction the reviewer identifies into a new arc
  in this file.

**Why this is on the agenda even though agents can't do it:** at the
project's current maturity, human-mathematician input may be the only
source of genuinely new direction.

## How to use this file

**Starting a session:**
1. Read this file to find an arc to continue.
2. If no arc fits, check NOVELTY_CHALLENGES.md for a single-session target.
3. If you start an arc that wasn't here, add it.

**During a session:**
1. Mark your arc as `Status: IN PROGRESS — <session number>`.
2. Don't context-switch between arcs unless one is blocked.

**Ending a session:**
1. Update the arc's milestones (check off completed items).
2. Update the arc's `Next action:` to whatever the next agent should do.
3. If you completed the arc, move it to "Closed arcs" with a one-line
   summary and pointer to the resulting artifact.
4. If your session created a new arc (e.g., a research direction that
   needs follow-up), add it to "Active arcs" with status NOT STARTED.

**The next-action discipline matters most.** Agents have short context
windows. A clear next-action lets the next agent pick up without
re-reading the whole arc history.
